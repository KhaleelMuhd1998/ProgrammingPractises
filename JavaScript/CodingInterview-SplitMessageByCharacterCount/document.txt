You are developing a text messaging system where messages can be split across multiple parts if they exceed a certain length. Design a function that takes a message string and a maximum part length (N) as input. The function should split the message into parts of maximum length N, but with two special rules: 1) Words should never be split in the middle (split only at spaces) 2) Each part should be numbered in the format '(X/Y)' where X is the current part number and Y is the total number of parts, and this format should be included at the start of each part. The numbering format itself should be included in the character count for each part.
